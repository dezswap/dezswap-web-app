            These Terms of Service (the “Agreement”) explain the terms and
            conditions by which you may access and use https://app.dezswap.io, a
            website-hosted user interface (the “Interface” or “App”) provided by
            DELIGHT LABS (“we”, “our”, or “us”). You must read this Agreement
            carefully as it governs your use of the Interface. By accessing or
            using the Interface, you signify that you have read, understand, and
            agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not
            agree, you are not authorized to access or use the Interface and
            should not use the Interface.

            NOTICE: This Agreement contains important information, including a
            binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver, both of
            which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. The
            Interface is only available to you — and you should only access the
            Interface — if you agree completely with these terms.
            <br />
            <br />
            Introduction
          </BoldContent>
          <Content>
            The Interface provides access to a decentralized protocol on the
            XPLA Chain, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital
            assets (“the Dezswap protocol” or the “Protocol”). The Interface is
            one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol.
            <br />
            To access the Interface, you must use non-custodial wallet software,
            which allows you to interact with the XPLA Chain. Your relationship
            with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the
            applicable terms of service of that third party, not this Agreement.
            Wallets are not operated by, maintained by, or affiliated with us,
            and we do not have custody or control over the contents of your
            wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By
            connecting your wallet to our Interface, you agree to be bound by
            this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by
            reference.
            <br />

          <BoldContent>Modification of this Agreement</BoldContent>
          <Content>
            We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to modify this
            Agreement from time to time. If we make any material modifications,
            we will notify you by updating the date at the top of the Agreement
            and by maintaining a current version of the Agreement at&nbsp;

            . All modifications will be effective when they are posted, and your
            continued accessing or use of the Interface will serve as
            confirmation of your acceptance of those modifications. If you do
            not agree with any modifications to this Agreement, you must
            immediately stop accessing and using the Interface.

            Description of Services provided through the Interface
          </BoldContent>
          <Content>
            The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of accessing the
            Protocol.
            <br />
            The Interface is distinct from the Protocol and is one, but not the
            exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself
            comprises open-source or source-available self-executing smart
            contracts that are deployed on the XPLA Chain. We do not operate the
            Protocol on the XPLA Chain. By using the Interface, you understand
            that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us and that
            we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control
            trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades,
            those fees accrue to liquidity providers for the Protocol. As a
            general matter, we are not a liquidity provider into Protocol
            liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third
            parties. The Protocol was deployed on the XPLA Chain. Please note
            that digital assets that have been “bridged” or “wrapped” to operate
            on other blockchain networks are distinct from the original XPLA
            mainnet asset.

          <BoldContent>Eligibility</BoldContent>
          <Content>
            To access or use the Interface, you must be able to form a legally
            binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at
            least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and have the full
            right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms
            and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any
            company or legal entity for which you may access or use the
            Interface.
            <br />
            You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic
            or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental
            authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or
            restricted parties including but not limited to the lists maintained
            by the relevant authorities of the Republic of Korea, the United
            States, the United Kingdom, or the European Union; or (b) a citizen,
            resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is the
            subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional
            economic sanctions by the Republic of Korea, the United States, the
            United Kingdom, the European Union or other relevant jurisdictions.
            Finally, you represent that your access and use of the Interface
            will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations and that
            you will not access or use the Interface to conduct, promote, or
            otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.

          <Content>
            We are not registered as a securities exchange with a regulatory
            authority in pertinent jurisdictions or in any other capacity. You
            understand and acknowledge that we do not broker trading orders on
            your behalf nor do we collect or earn fees from your trades on the
            Interface. We also do not facilitate the execution or settlement of
            your trades, which occur entirely on the public distributed
            blockchain, which is the XPLA Chain. As a result, we do not (and
            cannot) guarantee market best pricing or best execution through the
            Interface or when using our Auto Routing feature, which routes
            trades across liquidity pools on the Protocol only. Any references
            in the Interface to “best price” do not constitute a representation
            or warranty about pricing available through the Interface, on the
            Protocol, or elsewhere.

            <br />
            We may provide information about tokens in the Interface sourced
            from third-party data partners through features such as token
            explorer or token lists (which includes the default token list and
            verified token lists hosted at assets.xpla.io/cw20/tokens.json and
            assets.xpla.io/ibc/tokens.json). We may also provide verified labels
            or warning dialogs for certain tokens. The provision of
            informational materials does not make trades in those tokens
            solicited; we are not attempting to induce you to make any purchase
            as a result of the information provided. All such information
            provided by the Interface is for informational purposes only and
            should not be construed as investment advice or a recommendation
            that a particular token is a safe or sound investment. You should
            not take, or refrain from taking, any action based on any
            information contained in the Interface. By providing token
            information for your convenience, we do not make any investment
            recommendations to you or opine on the merits of any transaction or
            opportunity. You alone are responsible for determining whether any
            investment, investment strategy, or related transaction is
            appropriate for you based on your personal investment objectives,
            financial circumstances, and risk tolerance.

          <BoldContent>Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties</BoldContent>
          <Content>
            The Interface is a purely non-custodial application, meaning we do
            not ever have custody, possession, or control of your digital assets
            at any time. It further means you are solely responsible for the
            custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset
            wallets you hold and you should never share your wallet credentials
            or seed phrase with anyone. We accept no responsibility for, or
            liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and make
            no representations or warranties regarding how the Interface will
            operate with any specific wallet. Likewise, you are solely
            responsible for any associated wallet and we are not liable for any
            acts or omissions by you in connection with or as a result of your
            wallet being compromised.
            <br />
            This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose
            any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law,
            you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or
            liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any
            such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those
            duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived,
            and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and
            obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this
            Agreement.

          <Content>
            The Interface may not be available or appropriate for use in your
            jurisdiction. By accessing or using the Interface, you agree that
            you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws
            and regulations that may apply to you.
            <br />
            Specifically, your use of the Interface or the Protocol may result
            in various tax consequences, such as income or capital gains tax,
            value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in certain
            jurisdictions.
            <br />
            It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any
            transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or
            remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.

          <BoldContent>Assumption of Risk</BoldContent>
          <Content>
            By accessing and using the Interface, you represent that you are
            financially and technically sophisticated enough to understand the
            inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and
            blockchain-based systems including automated market making smart
            contract systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage
            and intricacies of digital assets such as XPLA, so-called
            stablecoins, and other digital tokens such as those following the
            Cosmwasm Token Spec (CW-20).
            <br />
            In particular, you understand that the markets for these digital
            assets are nascent and highly volatile due to risk factors including
            (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security,
            and regulation. You understand that anyone can create a token,
            including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely
            claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk
            that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. So-called
            stablecoins may not be as stable as they purport to be, may not be
            fully or adequately collateralized, and may be subject to panics and
            runs.
            <br />
            Further, you understand that smart contract transactions
            automatically execute and settle, and that blockchain-based
            transactions are irreversible when confirmed. You acknowledge and
            accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and
            blockchain-based systems such as XPLA Chain are variable and may
            increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and
            accept the risk of trading with additional parameters&apos; settings
            (slippage tolerance, auto-router, and transaction deadline), which
            can expose you to potentially significant price slippage and higher
            costs.
            <br />
            If you act as a liquidity provider to the Protocol through the
            Interface, you understand that your digital assets may lose some or
            all of their value while they are supplied to the Protocol through
            the Interface due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens in a
            trading pair or liquidity pool.
            <br />
            Finally, you understand that we do not make any representation or
            warranty about the safety or soundness of any cross-chain bridge.
            <br />
            In summary, you acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of
            these variables or risks, do not own or control the Protocol, and
            cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience
            while accessing or using the Interface. Accordingly, you understand
            and agree to assume full responsibility for all of the risks of
            accessing and using the Interface to interact with the Protocol.

            We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes
            through informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential dispute
            arises, you must contact us by sending an email to
            contact@dezswap.io so that we can attempt to resolve it without
            resorting to formal dispute resolution. If we aren&apos;t able to
            reach an informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then
            you and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to
            the process set forth below.

            any claim or controversy as to arbitrability (&quot;Dispute&quot;),
            shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration in
            accordance with the International Arbitration Rules of the Korean
            Commercial Arbitration Board(KCAB Rules). The number of arbitrators
            shall be three. The seat, or legal place, of arbitral proceedings
            shall be Seoul/Republic of Korea. The language to be used in the
            arbitral proceedings shall be English. Unless we agree otherwise,
            the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any
            other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator
            may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.
